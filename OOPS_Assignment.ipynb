        "Q. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to represent data and methods. It's based on the concept of organizing software around real-world objects or entities, with each object containing both data (attributes) and behavior (methods or functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "   The main principles are as follow\n",
        "\n",
        "   1: Encapsulation: This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2: Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and providing a simplified interface for interacting with the object\n",
        "\n",
        "   3: Inheritance: This allows a new class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class\n",
        "\n",
        "   4:Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the structure and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have.  \n",
        "\n",
        "   A class basically includes Attributes(Data and variable) and methods(function).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   An object is an instance of a class. Once a class is defined, you can create objects from that class. An object represents a specific entity in your program and has its own state and behavior based on the class definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Abstraction is about simplifying and hiding complexity by exposing only essential features and operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access to an objects internal state, allowing controlled interaction via methods.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __add__, etc. These methods are used to define how objects of a class behave in certain situations, such as when they are printed, compared, or interacted with using operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class (called a child or subclass) to inherit the attributes and methods from another class (called a parent class). Inheritance allows the code to reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Polymorphism in OOP allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to define methods that work in many different ways depending on the objects actual type. This promotes flexibility, reusability, and easier maintenance in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's attributes or methods to prevent unintended interference or modification of the object's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes and set up its initial state. In Python, the constructor is defined using the __init__ method, which is a dunder (double underscore) method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "       A class method is a method that is bound to the class, not an instance of the class. It can modify the class state that applies to all instances of the class, but it cannot access instance-specific data    (i.e., instance attributes). Class methods take at least one argument, which is typically called cls, referring to the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Static Methods:\n",
        "       A static method is a method that does not take self or cls as its first argument, and it is bound to the class rather than an instance. Static methods cannot modify object state (instance variables) or class state (class variables). They are mainly used for utility functions that are related to the class but don’t need access to the class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Method overloading is a concept that allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (such as different numbers or types of arguments). In many languages like Java or C++, method overloading is natively supported.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Python doesn't directly support method overloading, but you can achieve similar functionality using default arguments, variable-length arguments, or by manually checking the types and numbers of arguments passed to the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). This allows the subclass to redefine or extend the behavior of the inherited method to suit its needs.\n",
        "  In Python, method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name and signature (parameters) as a method in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  In Python, the @property decorator is a built-in function that allows you to define a method in a class that behaves like an attribute. This enables you to define getter methods that can be accessed like attributes, without explicitly calling them as methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it plays a crucial role in making code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable and supports scalability by making it easy to add new features without modifying existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   n abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is intended to be subclassed by other classes. It provides a blueprint for other classes, defining methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. Abstract classes are used when you want to define a common interface for a group of related classes but do not want the parent class itself to be used to create objects. Python provides the abc module (Abstract Base Classes) to define abstract classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   OOP provides several advantages that make software development easier and more efficient:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1 Modularity and reusability of code through classes and inheritance.\n",
        "   2 Abstraction to hide complexity and focus on essential features.\n",
        "   3 Encapsulation to protect data and provide controlled access.\n",
        "   4 Inheritance to create new classes based on existing ones.\n",
        "   5 Polymorphism to make your code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "   6 Maintainability and scalability for large, complex systems.\n",
        "   7 Easier collaboration and improved debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Class variables are shared across all instances of a class and hold values that are common to all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Instance variables are unique to each instance and hold values that are specific to that particular instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Both types of variables are essential for modeling different behaviors and attributes in your classes, allowing for flexible and efficient object-oriented designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means that a class can have multiple base classes and inherit attributes and methods from all of them. Multiple inheritance is supported natively in Python and allows for more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. __str__:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Purpose: The __str__ method is meant to return a human-readable string representation of an object. It is primarily used for display purposes, such as when you call print() or use str() on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Usage: This method should provide a nice, informal string that describes the object in a way that is easy to understand for users or developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. __repr__:\n",
        "\n",
        "      Purpose: The __repr__ method is intended to provide an official string representation of the object that can, ideally, be used to recreate the object. The output of __repr__ should be unambiguous and a valid Python expression if possible. It's often used for debugging, logging, or when you want a precise representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Usage: This method is used primarily for debugging or in situations where you need an accurate, detailed representation of an object.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   The super() function in Python is a built-in function that is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) class. It is especially useful in the context of inheritance, allowing you to access methods and attributes from a parent class without explicitly referring to the parent class name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   The __del__ method in Python is a special method, often referred to as the destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is part of Python's garbage collection mechanism and is typically used to clean up resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or freeing up memory that is not automatically managed by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   @staticmethod - A static method doesn't take a reference to the instance or class (no self or cls argument). It's essentially a regular function that's included in a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "   Typically used for utility functions that don't modify class or instance state but logically belong to the class.\n",
        "   When the method doesn't need access to the instance or class but is still logically related to the class.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   @classmethod - A class method takes a reference to the class as its first argument (cls), not the instance. It can access or modify the class state.\n",
        "   Used when you need to operate on class-level data or perform actions related to the class itself rather than individual instances.\n",
        "   When the method needs to access or modify class-level data or behavior, or when it's related to the class as a whole.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Q: How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Polymorphism in Python, especially in the context of inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables methods to be used interchangeably, even if they are implemented differently in different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   Method chaining in Python (or in object-oriented programming in general) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, one after the other. This is made possible by having each method return the object itself, or a reference to the same object, allowing subsequent method calls to be \"chained\" together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   The __call__ method in Python allows instances of a class to be invoked like functions.\n",
        "   It provides flexibility and the ability to define custom behavior when an object is \"called\".\n",
        "   Common use cases include function objects, callbacks, event handlers, and decorators.\n",
